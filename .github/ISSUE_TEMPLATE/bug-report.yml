      value: |
        1. Do **NOT** use this ticket/issue system for support requests! It is meant to be used to report bugs only and not to search for help if you have problems using RaspberryMatic.
        2. Do **NOT** submit bug reports about anything but the two most recently released versions!
        3. Before you open a new bug/issue report here, please make sure that it hasn't been reported yet and please make sure to cross-check the discussion fora discussed below and try to discuss your problem there first before you are opening a new bug report here.

        If you have problems while using RaspberryMatic and are seeking for help, please consult our [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/discussions) or the public [RaspberryMatic Forum](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewforum.php?f=65).
