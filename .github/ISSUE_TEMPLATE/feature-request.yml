        1. Do **NOT** use this form for support requests! It is meant to be used to request new feature or report your ideas on enhancements only.
        2. Make sure that the requested feature is not already implemented in the latest stable or even nightly build version of RaspberryMatic.
        3. Before you open a new feature/enhancement request here, please make sure that it hasn't been requested already and please make sure to cross-check the discussion fora discussed below and try to discuss your idea there first before you are opening a new feature request here.

        If you have problems while using RaspberryMatic and are seeking for help, please consult our [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/discussions) or the public [RaspberryMatic Forum](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewforum.php?f=65).
