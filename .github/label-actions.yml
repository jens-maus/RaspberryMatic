      @{issue-author}, the maintainer of this project has requested more

      @{issue-author}, the issue ticket you created does not seem to report
      a general issue/problem/bug in RaspberryMatic itself, but rather seems to
      point at a local usage issue that rather requires some support using
      a discussion or support fora. It will therefore be moved to the
      [discussion area](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/discussions)
      where you can continue for identifying solutions to your issue.

      @{issue-author}, the issue you reported does not seem to be reproducible
      by the maintainer of this project. Please provide additional information
      and more detail and please try to reproduce your problem with a fresh
      test installation and try to find other users having the same problems
      so that they can support your observations.

# third-party issue label added
':arrow_right: third-party issue':
  issues:
    comment: >
      @{issue-author}, the issue you reported cannot be solved within this
      project or should be better directly solved in a third-party project
      RaspberryMatic just uses. So please consider creating an additional
      issue ticket in this third-party project. If still relevant we can
      keep this issue ticket open here for the time being so that you can
      use it as a reference in issue tickets for the third-party report.

# upstream issue label added

    comment: >
      @{issue-author}, the issue you reported cannot be solved within this
      project or should be better directly solved in the upstream [OCCU](https://github.com/eq-3/occu)
      project RaspberryMatic is just using. However, for being able to
      reference and track this upstream issue we will keep this ticket
      open for the time being so that you can also reference it accordingly.

# duplicate issue label added

  issues:
    comment: >
      @{issue-author}, the maintainer of this project has flagged this issue
      ticket as a duplicate of an already reported issue. It will therefore
      be closed and you are advised to move over to the other ticket. In
      addition, please also make sure to first walk through and search in
      the issue section for a similar issue report before you create a new one.

    comment: >
      @{issue-author}, the maintainer of this project has decided that the
      issue/idea you reported does not seem to be relevant for the projects'
      mission or that it is out of the scope or simply not explained in
      enough detail. This ticket will therefore be closed and you are advised
      to better discuss this issue in more detail in the [discussion area](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/discussions) of this project and then perhaps come back here
      and open a new issue in case consensus has been achieved within this
      discussion.
