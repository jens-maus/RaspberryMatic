we accept security fixes only on the latest released version and also on the sources published
in the master branch of this GitHub project.

using our valuable issue tracker on GitHub. Furthermore, please acknowledge that we will try
to respond to your security reports as fast as possible and also please make sure to provide proper
examples (e.g. example source code, step-by-step explainations) on how to reproduce the security
issue so that we can reproduce and fix this issue as fas as possible.
