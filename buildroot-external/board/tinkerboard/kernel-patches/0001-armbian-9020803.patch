Subject: [PATCH 04/28] dts: rk3288: miqi: Enabling the Mali GPU node

Why is the MiQi the only one left without a working mali GPU node ?

Seriously, is there a rk3288 chipset WITHOUT a mali GPU ? Couldn't
they enable it once in the DTSI, instead of defining it as "disabled"
and enabling it in every DTS file ?

Subject: [PATCH 05/28] ARM: dts: rockchip: fix the regulator's voltage range
 on MiQi board

The board declared too narrow a voltage range for the CPU and GPU
regulators, preventing it from using the full CPU frequency range.
The regulators support 712500 to 1500000 microvolts.

Subject: [PATCH 06/28] ARM: dts: rockchip: add the MiQi board's fan definition

The MiQi board is sold with an enclosure in which a fan is connected
to the second LED output, and configured by default in "heartbeat"
mode so that it rotates slowly and increases when the CPU load
increases, ensuring appropriate cooling by default. This LED output
is called "Fan" in the original kernel and connected to GPIO18
(gpiochip 0, pin 18). Here we called it "miqi:green:fan" to stay
consistent with the kernel's naming conventions.

It's worth noting that without this patch the fan doesn't work at
all, risking to make the board overheat.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: DTS: rk3288-tinker: Enabling SDIO and Wifi

Adding the appropriate nodes in order to exploit the WiFi capabilities
of the board.
Since these capabilities are provided through SDIO, and the SDIO
nodes were not defined, these were added too.

These seems to depend on each other so they are added in one big
patch.

Split if necessary.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: DTS: rk3288-tinker: Setup the Bluetooth UART pins

The most essential being the RTS pin, which is clearly needed to
upload the initial configuration into the Realtek Bluetooth
chip, and make the Bluetooth chip work.

Now, the Bluetooth chip also needs 3 other GPIOS to be enabled.
I'll see how I do that through the DTS file in a near future.

The 3 GPIOS being :
Bluetooth Reset : <&gpio4 29 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
Bluetooth Wake  : <&gpio4 26 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
Bluetooth Wake_Host_IRQ : <&gpio4 31 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>

These are currently setup manually, through scripts. But it seems that
GPIO handling through /sys entries might not be possible in the long
term, the replacement being libgpio.
Anyway, if you're interesting in enabling the Bluetooth GPIO by hand,
here are the commands :

cd /sys/class/gpio &&
echo 146 > export &&
echo 149 > export &&
echo 151 > export &&
echo high > gpio146/direction &&
echo high > gpio149/direction &&
echo high > gpio151/direction

Resetting the chip is done like this :

echo "Resetting the Bluetooth chip"
cd /sys/class/gpio/gpio149 &&
echo 0 > value &&
sleep 1 &&
echo 1 > value &&
sleep 1

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: DTS: rk3288-tinker: Defining the SPI interface

Taken from, and tested by @TonyMac32 .

Well, the original one was tested by him but I had to adapt the
registers definitions to the new 64-bits LPAE-compliant syntax.

Therefore that *might* break, along with a few other patches.

Subject: [PATCH 26/26] ARM: DTSI: rk3288: Set the VPU MMU power domains

Without that, the auto-activation of the VPU hardware IOMMU fails
when enabling the hardware, before the "probe" phase of its device
driver.

Basically, when loading a "of_platform" device driver targeting
the VPU devices, you'll get these errors without this patch :

[12753.996950] rk_iommu ff9c0440.iommu: Error during raw reset. MMU_DTE_ADDR is not functioning
[12754.007483] rk_iommu ff9c0440.iommu: Disable stall request timed out, status: 0xffffffff
[12754.026652] rk_iommu ff9c0440.iommu: Disable paging request timed out, status: 0xffffffff
[12754.045975] rk_iommu ff9c0440.iommu: Disable stall request timed out, status: 0xffffffff

When using this patch, the errors disappear.

This seems to be due to the IOMMU device sharing the same power domain
than the device.
When loading an "of_platform" driver, the kernel logic seems to try
enabling the associated IOMMU device before letting the driver handles
anything with the actual VPU hardware.
It appears that setting the power domain of the VPU IOMMU nodes let the
IOMMU driver enable the IOMMU shared power domain, and make the IOMMU
device useable.

https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg673156.html

The original description was :

    Add the VOP DCLKs to the assigned clocks list so their
    parents can be set in the dts include files for
    devices that do dedicate npll to a vop.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] arm: dts: veyron: Added a flag to disable cache flush
 during reset

Flushing the MMC cache of ASUS Chromebooks during initialization or
"recovery" generates 10 minutes hangup, according to @SolidHal.

This is an adaptation of @SolidHal, in order to pinpoint the fix to
Veyron Chromebooks, and avoiding issues other RK3288 boards.

Subject: [PATCH] clk: rockchip: add all known operating points to the allowed
 CPU freqs

Patch from Willy Tarreau

Original commit message :
At least 1920 MHz runs stable on the MiQi even on openssl speed -multi 4,
which is by far the most intensive workload, and 1992/2016 work fine on
the CS-008 until it starts to heat too much. So add all of them so that
the device tree can simply manipulate them.

Subject: [PATCH] drivers: mmc: dw-mci-rockchip: Handle ASUS Tinkerboard reboot

On ASUS Tinkerboard systems, if the SDMMC hardware is shutdown before
rebooting, the system will be dead, as the SDMMC is the only way to
boot anything, and the hardware doesn't power up the SDMMC hardware
automatically when rebooting.

So, when using an ASUS Tinkerboard system, a new reboot handler is
installed. This reboot handler takes care of powering the SDMMC
hardware again before restarting the system, resolving the issue.

The code was inspired by the pwrseq_emmc.c, which seems to overcome
similar effects with eMMC hardware.

This commit caused issues on veyron speedy with ath9k and dwc2 drivers. Any ath9k device (ar9271) 
would intermittently work, most of the time ending in errors as can bee seen here:
https://github.com/SolidHal/PrawnOS/issues/38
This commit fixes that issue.
This is only a temporary work around while a permenant fix is found, as this commit seems to only cause issues
with dwc2

Subject: [PATCH] clk: rockchip: rk3288: Support for dedicating NPLL to a VOP

This patch is taken from Urja Rannikko ( @urjaman ) patchset here :
https://github.com/urjaman/arch-c201/blob/master/linux-c201/0020-RK3288-HDMI-clock-hacks-combined.patch
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg673156.html

I'm not really sure what this does exactly. It basically sets the
parent clock of the newly added clocks, if the newly added property
"rockchip,npll-for-vop" is detected and set.

I have no clear idea how HDMI Neuronal PLL (and PLL in general) work,
so I cannot comment on what it's doing and if it's a good idea in
general.

Now, I still have to test if that patch does anything useful on
RK3288 boards. If it doesn't, I might just throw it away on next
versions.

Subject: [PATCH 6/6] drm: dw_hdmi-rockchip: better clock selection logic and
 dts-based rate list

This patch is taken from Urja Rannikko ( @urjaman ) patchset here :
https://github.com/urjaman/arch-c201/blob/master/linux-c201/0020-RK3288-HDMI-clock-hacks-combined.patch
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg673156.html

The original description was :
    This contains traces of the following commits from the ChromeOS 3.14
    tree, which improve RF/EMI performance and detach the clock selection
    logic from the HDMI PHY configurations, plus support for configuring
    the allowed clock rates via device tree as they are dependent on
    PLL configuration and maybe even the PCB layout and other hardware things,
    eg. interference to wifi or such (EMI).

    Rates that were allowed previous to this patch are added as the fallback
    list if no dts configuration exists.

    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: Adjust rockchip_mpll_cfg for 146.25
    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: expand the informal mpll config
    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: add slop to more tables
    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: redo rockchip hdmi to allow slop
    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: Use auto-generated tables
    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: Fixup the clock to be what we expect
    CHROMIUM: drm/rockchip: hdmi: adjust cklvl & txlvl for RF/EMI
    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: Set cur_ctr to 0 always
    CHROMIUM: drm: rockchip/dw_hdmi-rockchip: Decrease slop

https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg673163.html

This is the patch that takes into account the new property
"rockchip,hdmi-rates-hz" that allows the definition of the HDMI
frequencies in the DTS file.
This also change a lot of HDMI frequencies definition, so that
*will* require some extensive testing.

Still, if it works fine, this should make tinkering the HDMI
frequencies easier, in case you have a very special HDMI screen.
