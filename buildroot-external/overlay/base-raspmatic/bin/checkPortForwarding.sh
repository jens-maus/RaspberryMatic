# This script retrieves the public internet IP and uses "nmap" to
# try to identify open ports which could potentially link back to a CCU
# which means that a port forwarding has been setup in the internet
# router for which we need to trigger an alarm message in the WebUI.
#
# This script returns the following result codes:
#
# 0 = No port forwarding identified
# 1 = Identified port forwarding
#
