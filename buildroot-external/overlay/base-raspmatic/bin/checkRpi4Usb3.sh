# This script can be executed and will check if the underlying system is
# a RaspberryPi4 where one of the USB3 ports are running with USB3 speed
# together with a connected GPIO RF module (RPI-RF-MOD/HM-MOD-RPI-PCB)
# because this combination is known to rf interference issues due to the
# critical USB3 controller of the Pi4 which produces a lot of RF jam
# resulting in our 868MHz communication to not work properly.
#
# This script returns the following result codes:
# 0=Pi4 found with no USB3 device connectivity
# 1=non-Pi4 device or no GPIO use detected (will disable the watchdog)
# 2=critical USB3+GPIO rf module use identified -> watchdog-alarm!
#

# only continue if not disabled
