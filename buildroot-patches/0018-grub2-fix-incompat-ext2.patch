+Subject: fs/ext2: Ignore checksum seed incompat feature
+
+This incompat feature is used to denote that the filesystem stored its
+metadata checksum seed in the superblock. This is used to allow tune2fs
+changing the UUID on a mounted metdata_csum filesystem without having
+to rewrite all the disk metadata. However, the GRUB doesn't use the
+metadata checksum at all. So, it can just ignore this feature if it
+is enabled. This is consistent with the GRUB filesystem code in general
+which just does a best effort to access the filesystem's data.
+
+The checksum seed incompat feature has to be removed from the ignore
+list if the support for metadata checksum verification is added to the
+GRUB ext2 driver later.

+Subject: fs/ext2: Ignore the large_dir incompat feature
+
+Recently, ext4 added the large_dir feature, which adds support for
+a 3 level htree directory support.
+
+The GRUB supports existing file systems with htree directories by
+ignoring their existence, and since the index nodes for the hash tree
+look like deleted directory entries (by design), the GRUB can simply do
+a brute force O(n) linear search of directories. The same is true for
+3 level deep htrees indicated by large_dir feature flag.
+
+Hence, it is safe for the GRUB to ignore the large_dir incompat feature.
