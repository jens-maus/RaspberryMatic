# ChangeLog

## 0.3.1
- fix OpenCCU container auto-detection to support both legacy `addon_*_<slug>` and newer Supervisor `app_*_<slug>` naming schemes.
- update helper documentation to clarify supported Home Assistant Supervisor container naming variants.

## 0.3.0
- add optional `openccu_mac` configuration for pinning the OpenCCU macvlan MAC address.
- improve automatic MAC handling by incrementing only the parent MAC's last octet, ignoring stopped containers, reusing the current OpenCCU MAC on helper restarts, and avoiding reuse of the parent NIC MAC.
- allow empty and `null` optional add-on settings, including an unset `check_interval`, and default the interval to 15 seconds when omitted.
- refine validation, error handling, and documentation for MAC selection and helper configuration.

## 0.2.0
- initial release of the dedicated OpenCCU HAP/DRAP-Helper add-on.
- create and maintain a dedicated macvlan Docker network for the OpenCCU Home Assistant add-on.
- connect OpenCCU with a stable LAN IP and keep the required multicast and default routes in place for HmIP-HAP and HmIPW-DRAP communication.
