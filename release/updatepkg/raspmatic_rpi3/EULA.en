<body>
<p>You are about to install a third-party firmware on your CCU device.
This <a href=https://raspberrymatic.de/>RaspberryMatic</a> firmware
consists of the same feature set like the original eQ-3 vendor CCU
firmware with the same version number. On top of that it
comes with some additional features and first hand bugfixes that
the vendor firmware has not yet integrated.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that you can reinstall the vendor CCU firmware
at any time and thus return to the vendor-supported firmware. In
addition, your configuration and settings will be automatically
converted to be usable with the RaspberryMatic firmware. We do,
however, suggest that you create a fresh backup before actually
installing this firmware on your CCU device.</p>
